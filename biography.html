		Back in 1983, Oprah took over the Chicago morning talk show AM Chicago, which had horrible ratings at the time. And, as you could probably imagine, Oprah instantly made the show great and it soon surpassed Donahue, which was the highest-rated Chicago talk show at the time.

		Soon after, she was convinced to sign a syndication deal with King World, and the show was then renamed The Oprah Winfrey Show. The first official episode premiered on Sept. 8, 1986, and lasted until May 25, 2011. In the early â€™90s, the show averaged about 13.1 million viewers per day!
